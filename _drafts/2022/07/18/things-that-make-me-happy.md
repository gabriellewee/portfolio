Because I was sick [earlier this year](/writes/2022/03/18/brain-fog/), I feel like I finally really got into the swing of things when summer started. I unfortunately haven‘t been able to travel, which I do miss, but there‘s been so many things at home that have made me just as happy.

## Desk

While I‘ve been working from home for the entirety of the pandemic, I‘ve never actually worked on my desk setup. I‘ve never even owned a desk - when I was a child, I did my homework on the kitchen table. When I was in college, I worked at school since I needed the computers for my 3d work. When I moved out of my parents‘ house to be closer to work, I didn‘t buy a desk since all my work was done in the office and I gamed primarily on my Nintendo Switch.

I wanted a setup that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I have both a personal laptop and a work laptop, so I have to be able to switch between the two easily. I ended up purchasing the [Samsung M8 Smart Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/smart-monitors/32-m8-4k-smart-monitor-and-streaming-tv-pink-ls32bm80punxgo/) in pink, and it‘s worked out perfectly for me. I use a single USB-C cable to switch between my laptops, and use the mini-HDMI cable to connect to my Nintendo Switch for gaming.

I wasn‘t originally intending to have such a pink setup, but I guess I couldn‘t help but be drawn to my favorite color. I purchased the limited edition pink deskmat from Maisy Leigh x Grovemade, and I‘ve been loving it. I also used one of my old Sailor Moon-inspired illustrations as my desktop wallpaper.

I also had to make room for the best part of my desk setup - my cat Alfie. His cat tree is to the right of my desk, so I also set up a heat mat on that side of my desk so we can hang out while I work. I rearranged my whole desk for him (my laptop was originally on the right side) so I hope he appreciates it!

## Peripherals

I‘ve been eyeing custom mechanical keyboards for what feels like years, but I finally bit the bullet and built my own. I definitely did the most research I‘ve ever done for a purchase. Most of the parts were purchased from [KBDfans](https://kbdfans.com).

Putting together the keyboard was challenging. Luckily, I didn‘t have to solder, but still, I bent quite a few switch pins. I love the muted sound of the switches and I‘m proud of how it turned out.

I also recently purchased a [Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.html) in pink and it‘s been a game-changer. I‘m used to using my Magic Trackpad but instantly fell in love with using an ergonomic mouse. It also matches my desk setup!

## Steam Deck

I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a Steam Deck last month.
