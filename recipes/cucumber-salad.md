I’ve been making this spicy and refreshing cucumber salad every week since the weather started to warm up. It’s easy to prepare and goes well with all kinds of food. I mainly make it for Asian-style meals but have also loved adding this on top of crackers and creamy Brie cheese.

## Ingredients
- [ ] Mini cucumbers - 8
- [ ] Garlic - 5 cloves
- [ ] Green onions - 2 stalks
- [ ] Rice vinegar - 1/3 cup
- [ ] Soy sauce - 1 tsp
- [ ] Maggi seasoning - 1/2 tsp (optional)
- [ ] Mirin - 2 tsp
- [ ] Honey - 1 tbsp
- [ ] Sesame oil - 2 tsp
- [ ] Sesame seeds - 2 tbsp
- [ ] Korean red chili powder - 1/4 cup
- [ ] Kosher salt - 1 tbsp

## Steps
1. Thinly slice cucumbers using a mandolin or knife. Mix in a bowl with the kosher salt and set aside.
2. Mince garlic and finely slice green onions and set aside in a separate bowl.
3. Squeeze liquid out of salted cucumbers using your hands and set aside in a colander. Pour out any remaining liquid.
4. In the same bowl, combine the cucumbers and the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Serve immediately or fridge.
