This week has got to be the most exhausting week in my entire existence.

On Sunday, I started work on a group project only to discover that over half the work needed to be redone, so Sarah and I stayed up until 4:30am at her place to finish it, then took a precious two hours to sleep. We woke up again to go to school early, armed with Starbucks coffee, and printed out all our documents. We then zombied our way through eight hours of school. Seriously, we were lying on the floor and killing ourselves giggling at the ceiling.

I still haven't caught up on sleep, and school/work/relationships have been seriously stressing me out. I'm afraid that everything is going to fall on me all at once and I won't be able to handle it.

I had an idea I was all ready to write out and post, but honestly? I'm just too tired to deal with it.
