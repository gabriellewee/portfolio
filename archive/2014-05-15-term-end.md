title: Term End
---
Finally finished with the term! It was a harrowing eight weeks in which I had all-nighters at least once a week. I finally pulled through - my final was yesterday. Since then, I have had a total of at least twenty hours of sleep, if not more. Finally being able to catch up on my sleep has worked wonders.

In the game production class I took, we worked on modeling game level elements. Next term, we’ll be texturing and putting on the final touches for our models.

Here’s some of the work I did this term for my personal level, a Shinto-inspired shrine. My design was heavily influenced by the Heian Shrine in Japan. Creating the many beams and supports in Maya was tear-inducing and time-consuming, but I managed to lay out every last part. I’m not looking forward to texturing them next term, but I’m sure I will try my best.

I worked on a group level project with four of my classmates - the largest group in our class. Our level consists of a pre-art deco/baroque speakeasy. Here’s a few screenshots from the game engine:

I also completed three portfolio websites for some graduating classmates and a store site for a friend. The portfolio sites are hosted on Squarespace and the store on Big Cartel. Each person had a very specific style and included PSD versions of their site that were challenging to accomplish, but I persevered. I’m not used to doing exact replicas of mockups, but it was good for me to get some practice in. I’ll be posting all of them in my portfolio eventually, but I’m waiting for a few to finish posting their content to take proper screenshots.

It’s been a busy term, and I’m glad I got some rest. I’m excited to see what I can do in the new term, which starts in just four days. Now it’s time for me to sleep again. What a lovely thought.
