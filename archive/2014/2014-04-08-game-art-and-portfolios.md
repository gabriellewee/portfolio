It's been quite a while since I updated this site. Since Dunked.com started charging for their services, I have deleted my account with them and am in the process of moving my portfolio to this website. I'll be delving into Jekyll once more to work out a suitable template for my portfolio.

As far as school goes, I'm currently in Game Pro I, where we build two game levels - one personal level as a solo project and one collaborative effort with a group of classmates. I'll probably post work from the group level when we are further along in the project. For my personal level, I decided to do a shrine haunted by spirits who manifest as blue lights in lanterns and other lit objects scattered around the level. The architecture is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto shrines as well as Buddhist temples in Korea and China.

I've also been doing some web design. One of my best friends is starting a t-shirt company with some other people on Big Cartel, and I am in the process of coding the store layout. I'm also working on Squarespace portfolio site templates for two of my school friends. For all three sites, I received very specific instructions on the look and feel, including PSDs and example sites to work from. It's quite a different experience since I tend to start with a vague idea that evolves as I code, but this kind of challenge is good for me since I learn to work with and around other people's design work.

Anyways, I'll be back soon with an updated portfolio and more updates!
